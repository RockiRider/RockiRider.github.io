# Portfolio Website
https://tsotne.co.uk
## Why
I created it to have a place to showcase my projects in a structured way for myself and use it to display my abilities to employers.

## How
I used vanilla HTML , CSS and JS whilst dipping a little bit into jQuery. I used PHP for the email functionality in the "Contact Us" page. 

## Things I want to Improve
I would like to add a blog in the near future, it would allow more of a personal experience and allow users to see my step by step thought process behind each project.

### I try to keep it as up to date as possible, but please bear in mind its difficult to update when im focusing on multiple projects at the same time as well.
